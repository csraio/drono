        <br/>  <h1><strong>Friday 1/29/21</strong></h1>
            <br><p><strong> We founded the company today. The idea was to create a company that could solve a problem in the world. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals helped us to decide the realm of problems we wanted to solve. We spent all day today brainstorming and discussing possible topics. Today, we came up with a few ideas: 1) A website that would connect food pantries to nearby supermarkets who are throwing away edible food.
              2) A Bicycle power pack that would turn a regular bicycle into a fast, electric one. It would utilize solar powered batteries and be manufactured with recycled plastics. 
              3) A drone service to take survey cities and identify as well as map out concentrations of trash. </strong></p>

            <br><p><strong> 
              We decided to implement idea number 3 and turn it into a business for profit. Our business would use drones to take pictures of city streets and would map out where the trash, sorting groups of trash by concentration.  We would outsource our drones and equip them with our video analyzing algorithm. We would then sell these equipped drones to cities and other organizations that are looking to clean up their area with the highest effificiency.  
              Today, we used Figma to design the architecture of our website. We planned the homepage, our mission statement, our product page, a community outreach page, and this Blog page. </strong></p>

Today, we looked at the various UN Sustainable Development Goals and brainstormed possible solutions to these issues. Some of our ideas included masks that create water, an electric-powered bicycle, and a trash sensor to be used in cities. However, we were still unable to finalize our topic.

    <h1><strong> Saturday 1/30/21</strong></h1>
    <p> Today was the day we finally decided on our project. We decided to advance in the idea of a trash-sensor system. This eventually evolved into an aeriel drone-collection system that picked up trash cubes that a ground-robot had collected and compacted. Today was also the day that we gained experience in TinkerCAD. We built an autonomous washing machine system that would come to you instead of you going to it to collect your. This silly project provided us with invaluable experience in TinkerCAD that helped us create our robot/drone designs for our actual project. </p>

      <h1><strong> Sunday 1/31/21</strong></h1>
      <p>Today, we polished up our website. With most of it finished on Saturday night,  there wasn’t much left to do.  We added some images, implemented some JavaScript, and reminisced about our hard work in creating this project. Although it was long and difficult, our team made something that we were truly proud of: a website created truly from scratch</p>
