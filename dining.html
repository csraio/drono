              The food offerings in the pavilion strive to emulate the rich culture and history of the Gupta Empire. One way we hope to express the legacy of the Empire is through how we plan to adapt staples of Gupta dining into a modern adaptation, fit for today’s society.

              <h5><strong>In the Gupta Empire, Rice was a staple of any meal. As such, we will try our best to offer a variety of rice options, akin to what was available back then. In the empire, rice was taken along with curd, milk, clarified butter, molasses and pulses. However around 650 AD, Hindus began to worship a Mother Goddess. Cows were sacred to her, and so Hindus stopped eating beef pretty much completely, which does have the side benefit of accommodating to any vegetarian visitors to the pavilion. Food in Gupta Period along with this also included dairy products. While cow’s milk was the most commonplace, the period also included the milk of elephants, buffaloes, camel, goat, sheep and mares. Apart from milk, other products like curd, crème of curd and butter milk were especially popular. The food in Gupta Period included extensive use of honey in preparing sweet items. Four varieties of honey have been mentioned in the medical works of early Gupta period.</h5></strong>

              <h5><strong> on to the beverages that we will plan to offer,  there quite a few intoxicating drinks that have been mentioned in the Matsya Purana and in the Vayu Purana, said to be prepared from grapes, sugarcane, honey and rice. It also included types of wine which was flavored with mango juice and patala flower.
