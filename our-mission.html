        <h1><strong>Our Mission</strong></h1>
            <p><strong> 
              Cities are densely populated areas where trash can esaily accumulate. Our mission is to create a system in which this trash can be collected and transported out of the community. A trash-collecting machine located on the city’s sidewalks would collect the trash present in the area, and, when filled up, would be picked up by drone situated above the city. This trash would then be sent away from the city into a designated landfill area.
              </strong></p>
