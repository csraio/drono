              The DRONO cleanliness package includes our DRONO AirView drone, which will be used for analyzing areas with a high concentration of trash, and the Ground unit is included as well, which will go to areas designated by the drone and consolidate the trash into packages that can be picked up by the drone and disposed of responsibly. To lease the package, a flat fee of $12,000 is required and an hourly rate of $40 will be added to your invoice. The length of your lease can be determined individually but the predetermined options we offer include packages for 1 year, 2 years, or 6 months.</strong></p>
