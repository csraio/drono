        <br/>  <h1><strong>Friday 1/29/21</strong></h1>
            <br><p><strong> We founded the company today. The idea was to create a company that could solve a problem in the world. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals helped us to decide the realm of problems we wanted to solve. We spent all day today brainstorming and discussing possible topics. Today, we came up with a few ideas: 1) A website that would connect food pantries to nearby supermarkets who are throwing away edible food.
              2) A Bicycle power pack that would turn a regular bicycle into a fast, electric one. It would utilize solar powered batteries and be manufactured with recycled plastics. 
              3) A drone service to take survey cities and identify as well as map out concentrations of trash. </strong></p>

            <br><p><strong> 
              We decided to implement idea number 3 and turn it into a business for profit. Our business would use drones to take pictures of city streets and would map out where the trash, sorting groups of trash by concentration.  We would outsource our drones and equip them with our video analyzing algorithm. We would then sell these equipped drones to cities and other organizations that are looking to clean up their area with the highest effificiency.  
              Today, we used Figma to design the architecture of our website. We planned the homepage, our mission statement, our product page, a community outreach page, and this Blog page. </strong></p>
